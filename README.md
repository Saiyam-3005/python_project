An inventory management system is a software application used to track inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. It helps businesses know how many products they have, their prices, total sales, and customer details. This system is vital for shops with computer setups, as it automates the tracking process.

Key Components of an Inventory Management System:<br>
1.Product ID: Each product has a unique identifier.<br>
2.Product Name: The name of the product.<br>
3.Product Price: The cost of the product.<br>
4.Quantity: The amount of product available in stock.<br>

These details are crucial for managing inventory effectively. For a more detailed system, you can also include additional information, such as the manufacturing date, expiry date, and category of the product (e.g., groceries, electronics).
